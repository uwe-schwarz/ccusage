# Introduction

![ccusage daily report showing token usage and costs by date](/screenshot.png)

**ccusage** is a local CLI for understanding coding (agent) CLI token usage and estimated costs across Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Amp, Droid, Codebuff, Hermes Agent, pi-agent, Goose, OpenClaw, Kilo, Kimi, Qwen, GitHub Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, Grok Build CLI, and ZCode (Z.ai).

The original **“cc”** came from **C**laude **C**ode usage and now also fits **C**odex **C**LI usage. As OpenCode, Amp, Droid, Codebuff, Hermes Agent, pi-agent, Goose, OpenClaw, Kilo, Kimi, Qwen, Gemini CLI, Grok Build CLI, ZCode (Z.ai), and other coding (agent) CLIs became part of the same workflow, ccusage expanded into a general name for local coding CLI usage analysis.

## The Problem

Modern coding (agent) CLI usage is split across several local data formats. That makes basic questions hard to answer:

- How much am I actually using each coding CLI?
- Which conversations are the most expensive?
- What would I be paying on a pay-per-use plan?
- Which projects, sessions, or weeks are driving usage?

## The Solution

ccusage reads the local usage files that coding CLIs already generate and provides:

- **All Sources by Default** - Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Amp, Droid, Codebuff, Hermes Agent, pi-agent, Goose, OpenClaw, Kilo, Kimi, Qwen, GitHub Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, Grok Build CLI, and ZCode (Z.ai) in one CLI
- **Usage Views** - Daily, weekly, monthly, and session-based breakdowns
- **Cost Analysis** - Estimated costs based on token usage and model pricing
- **Focused Data Source Views** - Start with all detected sources, then narrow the same usage views to one source when needed
- **Data Source Pages** - Source-specific setup and extra features live with each supported data source
- **Multiple Formats** - Beautiful tables or JSON for further analysis

## How It Works

1. **Coding CLIs generate local usage files** containing usage data
2. **ccusage reads these files** from your local machine
3. **Analyzes and aggregates** the data by date, session, or time blocks
4. **Calculates estimated costs** using model pricing information
5. **Presents results** in beautiful tables or JSON format

## Key Features

### 🚀 Direct Execution

You can run ccusage without a global install using `bunx ccusage` (recommended), `pnpm dlx ccusage`, or `npx ccusage@latest`.

### 📊 Usage Views

- **All Sources (Default)** - Aggregates every detected supported source
- **Daily Usage** - Usage aggregated by calendar date
- **Weekly Usage** - Usage aggregated by week with configurable start day
- **Monthly Usage** - Monthly summaries with trends
- **Session Usage** - Per-conversation analysis

### 💰 Cost Analysis

- Estimated costs based on token counts and model pricing
- Support for different cost calculation modes
- Model-specific pricing across supported providers
- Cache token cost calculation

### Data Source Pages

Each data source page covers the details that only apply to that source, including custom directories, pricing notes, and source-specific commands.

### 🔧 Flexible Configuration

- **JSON Configuration Files** - Set defaults for all commands or customize per-command
- **IDE Support** - JSON Schema for autocomplete and validation
- **Priority-based Settings** - CLI args > local config > user config > defaults
- **Environment Variables** - Traditional configuration options
- **Custom Date Filtering** - Flexible time range selection and sorting
- **Offline Mode** - Cached pricing data for air-gapped environments

## Data Sources

ccusage reads from local coding CLI data directories:

| Agent          | ID         | Default data location                             |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code    | `claude`   | `~/.config/claude/projects/`, `~/.claude/`        |
| Codex          | `codex`    | `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}`                         |
| OpenCode       | `opencode` | `${OPENCODE_DATA_DIR:-~/.local/share/opencode}`   |
| Amp            | `amp`      | `${AMP_DATA_DIR:-~/.local/share/amp}`             |
| Droid          | `droid`    | `${DROID_SESSIONS_DIR:-~/.factory/sessions}`      |
| Codebuff       | `codebuff` | `${CODEBUFF_DATA_DIR:-~/.config/manicode}`        |
| Hermes Agent   | `hermes`   | `${HERMES_HOME:-~/.hermes}/state.db`              |
| pi-agent       | `pi`       | `${PI_AGENT_DIR:-~/.pi/agent/sessions}`           |
| Goose          | `goose`    | Standard Goose data roots or `GOOSE_PATH_ROOT`    |
| OpenClaw       | `openclaw` | `${OPENCLAW_DIR:-~/.openclaw}`                    |
| Kilo           | `kilo`     | `${KILO_DATA_DIR:-~/.local/share/kilo}`           |
| Kimi           | `kimi`     | `${KIMI_DATA_DIR:-~/.kimi}` (also `~/.kimi-code`) |
| Qwen           | `qwen`     | `${QWEN_DATA_DIR:-~/.qwen}`                       |
| Copilot CLI    | `copilot`  | `~/.copilot/otel/*.jsonl`                         |
| Gemini CLI     | `gemini`   | `${GEMINI_DATA_DIR:-~/.gemini/tmp}`               |
| Grok Build CLI | `grok`     | `${GROK_HOME:-~/.grok}`                           |
| ZCode (Z.ai)   | `zcode`    | `${ZCODE_HOME:-~/.zcode}/cli/db/db.sqlite`        |

The tool automatically detects available data and aggregates all supported coding CLIs by default.
Source-specific environment variables that support multiple roots can contain comma-separated directories, which lets unified reports combine current profiles and archives.

Some coding agents have been investigated but are not supported because their local files do not contain reliable token usage. See [Source Support Q&A](/guide/source-support-qa) for the current notes on Antigravity CLI, legacy Grok CLI SQLite data, and Devin CLI.

## Report Shape

Run ccusage without a source name to aggregate all detected sources:

```bash
ccusage daily
ccusage weekly
ccusage monthly
ccusage session
```

Add a data source namespace when you want the same report focused on one source:

```bash
ccusage claude daily
ccusage codex daily --speed fast
ccusage opencode weekly
ccusage amp session
ccusage droid daily
ccusage codebuff daily
ccusage hermes daily
ccusage pi monthly
ccusage goose daily
ccusage openclaw daily
ccusage kilo daily
ccusage kimi daily
ccusage qwen daily
ccusage copilot daily
ccusage gemini daily
ccusage grok daily
ccusage zcode daily
```

Use `ccusage <source> <report>` only when you want to narrow a report to one source.
